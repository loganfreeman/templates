## Employee Directory ##

### Sample Application built with Backbone.js and Twitter Bootstrap ###

"Backbone Directory" is a simple Employee Directory application built with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) and [Twitter Bootstrap] (http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/).

Refer to [this blog post](http://coenraets.org/blog/2013/04/sample-application-with-backbone-js-and-twitter-bootstrap-updated-and-improved/) for more information about the application.


The application runs out-of-the-box with an in-memory data store.

If you want to experiment the application with other persistence layers, download the REST services in the following repositories:

- [directory-rest-nodejs](https://github.com/ccoenraets/directory-rest-nodejs) (Node.js/MongoDB implementation)
- [directory-rest-php](https://github.com/ccoenraets/directory-rest-php) (PHP implementation)
- directory-rest-java (Java implementation coming soon)
